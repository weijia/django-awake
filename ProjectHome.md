### Motivation ###
Spreadsheets grow until they become painful and ugly. Migrating to a database is the next logical step. This project makes it easy to migrate to Django.

### Goals ###
  1. Generate Django models for each sheet in a spreadsheet.
  1. Populate those models with data from the spreadsheet.
  1. Enable simple editing via the Django admin interface.
